#  A Fittest IDE

We provide a box with smart, sharp tools that keep developers happy.
The toolbox is based on:

* zsh - a popular shell
* tmux - a terminal multiplexer: lets you switch easily between several
  programs in one terminal
* neovim - an extensible text editor based on vim,vi & ex

To these three interfaces we we add the plugins, frameworks and skins:

* pyenv - simple python version management
* antibody - zsh plugin manager
* tpm - tmux plugin manager
* liquidprompt - the best prompt, ever

When you install our IDE we will backup your conf files and 
link the files under `~/.afide/config` to their proper place:

    $ ll ~/.zshrc
    lrwxrwxrwx ... /home/daonb/.zshrc -> /home/daonb/.afide/config/zshrc

### Making Changes

If you want to change something, go ahead and edit one of the files.
All the configuration files are grouped into two directories: `/config` and
'/skin'.  Just don't forget to reset, to get your changes kick in:

* `exec zsh` when you change a `zsh*` file
* CTRL-aI for `tmux*` files
* `:source %` after changing your `init.vim`.

## Installation

### Debian/Ubuntu

First get the basic tools from distro packages (as root):

    apt get update
    apt get install neovim zsh tmux

Next, install antibody, pyenv, latest python and the virtual envs required:

    curl -sfL git.io/antibody | sh -s - -b /usr/local/bin
    curl https://pyenv.run | zsh
    exec "SHELL"
    pyenv install 2.7.15
    pyenv install 3.7.3
    pyenv virtualenv 2.7.15 afide2
    pyenv activate afide2 && pip install neovim
    pyenv virtualenv 3.7.3 afide3
    pyenv activate afide3 && pip install neovim
    git clone https://github.com/the-fittest-ide/a-fittest-ide.git ~/.afide
    cd ~/.afide
    make install

Open a new `zsh` and enjoy the fruits of evolution.

### Unistalling
If you decide it's not for you just `afide uninstall` and we'll remove ourselvs and restore the config files.
