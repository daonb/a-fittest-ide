#  Instlfittest-ide
### A repo dedicated to a tmux-zsh-vim IDE, the fittest of them all!

## Installation

Assuming you use a debian based OS:

```bash
sudo apt install zsh curl tmux neovim
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"<Paste>
```

Now that you have all the parts install, you need to configure the big three.
We'll start with zsh, where for now we will configure the theme
and set it to random:

```bash
sed -e  <to replace the theme> ~/.zshrc
```
